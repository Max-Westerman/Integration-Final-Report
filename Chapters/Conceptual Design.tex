\section*{Design Strategy}
Before the initial design process had begun, it was clear to the team that there would be a trade-off between complexity and efficiency - as such, it was determined that the complexity of the system would have to increase greatly in order to get the maximum potential performance from the robot. The following designs are variations of the previous, with each design increasing in complexity.
