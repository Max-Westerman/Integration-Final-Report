    \item[Speed Motor \#1:] To make the robot faster, the gearboxes of dead speed motors were swapped out with our slower, torque motors. The team utilized \emph{Savannah Prouty's} dead speed motor.
    
    \item[Speed Motor \#2:] As above, the team utilized \emph{Duncan Wood's} dead speed motor for its gearbox.

    \item[Speed Motor \#3:] As above, \emph{Mahesh Manandhar} provided the team with an extra, dead speed motor for its gearbox. 
    
    \item[\gls{PID} Guidance:] Although it did not make it into the final robot, \emph{Carter Sorenson} introduced the group to the possibility of using \gls{PID} control for the robot.
    
    \item[Motor Mounts:] The team did not check the provided components sufficiently, resulting in missing motor mounts. \emph{Savannah Prouty} provided the team with her extra motor mounts.
